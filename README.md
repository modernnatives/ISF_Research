📌 Overview

This repository contains the computational models, datasets, and supporting materials for the research on Informationally Structured Fields (ISF)—a unifying framework that integrates quantum mechanics, gravity, and electrodynamics through information-theoretic principles.

🔹 Key Contributions of ISF:
✅ ISF-Modified Einstein Equations – Entropy-driven corrections to gravity.
✅ ISF-Enhanced Schrödinger Equation – Quantum decoherence corrections.
✅ Electromagnetic Adjustments – Information-density-based modifications to Maxwell’s equations.
✅ Computational Simulations – Predicting ISF-induced gravitational wave dispersion & quantum effects.

This repository provides the necessary tools for researchers to explore ISF predictions, reproduce simulations, and analyze the effects of entropy-modulated spacetime.

⚙️ Installation Instructions

To use the ISF simulation code, you’ll need Python 3.x and the following dependencies:

1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ISF_Research.git
cd ISF_Research

2️⃣ Install Dependencies

Use pip to install required Python libraries:

pip install numpy scipy matplotlib sympy jupyter

🚀 Example Usage

1️⃣ Running the ISF Simulation Script

To run a basic ISF simulation, execute:

python isf_main_code.py

This will compute entropy-driven gravitational wave shifts, quantum decoherence rates, and electromagnetic effects under ISF principles.

2️⃣ Using Jupyter Notebook

For interactive simulations, open the Jupyter notebook:

jupyter notebook

Then, open isf_simulation.ipynb and run the cells to visualize ISF-modulated effects.

📊 Data Files

All experimental datasets are stored in the data/ folder:

✅ raw_data.csv – Original data from ISF simulations.
